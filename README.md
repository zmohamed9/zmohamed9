## Hi there 👋

My name is Zaina, and I am a tech student over at NAIT. I am currently studying **Web Design and Development**. 

:computer: I enjoy designing UI/UX as well as working on the FrontEnd Development. I'm currently learning how to work on the Backend with PHP and using a CMS like Wordpress. 

At the present, I'm working on a project for a charity company. 

You can reach me at my email address: **zainaamohamed12@gmail.com**. I look forward to speaking with you! 

:bike: *Fun Fact:* When I was younger, I was able to ride a unicycle. Unsure if that would still be the case now, but hey, never say never!
